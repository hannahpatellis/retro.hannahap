# Retroify for hannahap.com

As a big retro tech nerd, I wanted to be able to visit and browse my own website [hannahap.com](https://hannahap.com) on retro computers. This PHP script takes any page from my website and "retroifys" it by stripping out CSS, scripts, and HTML5 tags; processing all the images to be lo-res and saves them as GIF files; and serves it all over an insecure connection.

## To dos

- Better error handling
- Add ability to convert blog.hannahap.com pages as well
